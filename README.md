# 100-days-of-code
Sharing my learning journey.

I'm currently learning Python from Angela Yu's course
Learning DevOps from KubeKloud
Learning C, C++, Java, JS, html, css from an offline bootcamp.

The updates would be sporadic for DevOps and the offline bootcamp as I plan on making handwritten notes instead. I'll do long-form content/guides for them.

The updates for Angela's 100 days of code program (Python) would be regular though. 

Day 1: <a href="https://mukul.im/100-days-of-code-day-1-python/"> Learning about Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation & Variables</a>
